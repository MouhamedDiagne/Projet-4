# Project Number 4: Openclassroom AI Engineer Course

This repository is about the 4th project of the AI Engineer Course Openclassrooms. 

Context : Help a financial company to create a Machine Learning Solution that helps to decide the allocation or not of a loan depending on some informations like financial or familial situation, previous loan applications, etc.

The crucial points of the work may be: 
- preprocessing data 
- applying a model to a dataset and making predictions
- creating performance measures to evaluate a model
- balancing data; manage imbalanced datasets 
- optimize the hyperparameters of a model
- compare differents model and chose the one with the best performances
- optimize the threshold of your model to have better performances
- explain the inner workings of your model with Feature Importances
